# Future Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should cut volume and replace them with exercises
that will have more overall impact.

- Near term changes
    - Do some dead hangs w/ suppinated grip for better wrist health.

## Goals

- Third world squats
- Shoulder stretch (hands clasped behind back)
- One armed pushups
- Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Better glutes
- Add back in assisted chin-up volume
- Dips
    - Add back in weighted dips (once biceps happy)
    - Ring dips
- Front rack flexibility

## Changes to consider

- T-Spine
    - Loaded T-Spine extensions - once I'm happy with the unloaded version, these sound amazing.
    - Kneeling overhead rockbacks - dynamic option
- Banded Lat Smash
    - This is worth looking into - it sounds as if it might address some tightness I have?
- Switch to Bulgarian Split Squats or Cossack Squats
    - These should be better for general mobility and functional strength
    - I'm doing cossack squats as a stretch for now. Should be a good start
    - I think I should be able to program these as 5+4+3 clusters
    - If that doesn't work, there are other options
- Deadlifts in place of (or as well as) RDLs.
    - I love a heavy Deadlift! But, this doesn't really move me towards any of my goals.
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
    - Current routine may just cover it
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
    - Volume RDLs + Dead hangs should really do it for grip strength
- Calf raises, Calf stretches
    - My calves seem fine? So much DDR with so much weight...
- Core
    - I'm not sure I really need dedicated core work
    - Hanging Leg Raises
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
