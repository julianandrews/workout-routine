# Future Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should switch to once a week and replace them
with exercises that will have more overall impact.

## Exercises to consider

- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
- Hanging Leg Raises (for core)
- Rear Delt Flyes (for delt growth)
- Calf Raises (for calves)
- Dumbbell rows (in place of barbell)
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
