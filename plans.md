# Future Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should switch to once a week and replace them
with exercises that will have more overall impact.

## Goals

- Things I can't do well, that I'd like to:
    - Third world squats
    - Shoulder stretch (hands clasped behind back)

## Changes to consider

- Cluster sets in place of traditional for presses.
- Increase Face Pull frequency if upper cross syndrome progress is slow.
- Elevated OAPU in place of archer push-ups in another few weeks!
- Core
    - Hanging Leg Raises
        - Once Dead hangs reach 20s + I'll add a set of leg raises to the later part of the hang.
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
- Rear Delt Flyes (for delt growth)
- Calf Raises (for calves)
- Dumbbell rows (in place of barbell)
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
