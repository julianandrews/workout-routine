# Future Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should switch to once a week and replace them
with exercises that will have more overall impact.

## Goals

- Third world squats
- Shoulder stretch (hands clasped behind back)
- Fix upper cross syndrome
- One armed pushups
- Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Better glutes

## Changes to consider

- Switch to ring dips
- Elevated OAPU in place of archer push-ups in another few weeks!
- Increase Face Pull frequency if upper cross syndrome progress is slow.
    - Progress by controlled tempo - 3s pull, 2s squeeze, 3s eccentric
    - Consider one-arm variant (start with eccentric only?)
    - Consider banded face pulls if progression seems tricky
- Rear Delt Flyes (for delt growth)
    - Lat raises hit the side delts, and all the pressing does the front delts. Rear delts are a little underworked.
- Deadlifts in place of (or as well as) RDLs.
- Core
    - Hanging Leg Raises
        - Once Dead hangs reach 20s + I'll add a set of leg raises to the later part of the hang.
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
- Calf Raises (for calves)
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
