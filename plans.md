# Future Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should cut volume and replace them with exercises
that will have more overall impact.

- Near term changes
    - Elevated OAPU in place of archer push-ups in another few weeks!
    - Second set of rows (day 3?) for balance
    - Loaded T-Spine extensions
        - Once I'm happy with the unloaded version, these sound amazing.
    - Add back in assisted chin-ups (once biceps happy)
    - Dips
        - Add back in weighted dips (once biceps happy)
        - Ring dips
    - Switch to Bulgarian Split Squats
        - These should be better for general mobility and functional strength
        - I think I should be able to program these as 5+4+3 clusters
        - If that doesn't work, there are other options

## Goals

- Third world squats
- Shoulder stretch (hands clasped behind back)
- One armed pushups
- Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Better glutes

## Changes to consider

- Bulgarian split squats (in place of main squats maybe?)
- Deadlifts in place of (or as well as) RDLs.
    - I love a heavy Deadlift! But, this doesn't really move me towards any of my goals.
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
    - Current routine may just cover it
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
    - Volume RDLs + Dead hangs should really do it for grip strength
- Calf raises, Calf stretches
    - My calves seem fine? So much DDR with so much weight...
- Core
    - Hanging Leg Raises
        - Once Dead hangs reach 20s + I'll add a set of leg raises to the later part of the hang.
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
