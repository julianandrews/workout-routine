# Programming Notes

## Goals

- Should plan to work in some sort of front squat mobility work before too long

## General Notes

- Unless otherwise specified, progress each exercise every session by adding a rep
- Once the rep range is maxed, reset to the bottom and add weight
    - Add 5lbs for big lifts or 2.5lbs for smaller lifts
    - Optionally double that if it's feeling too easy
- In case of failure, deload 20% next week and continue
- Initial weights should be low enough that you could do an extra 2-3 reps, but
  high enough that you'd fail if you tried to do 5+ more.
- By default, I've aimed low on volume to minimize recovery and junk work
    - If an exercise feels like it's stalling we will deload and add *sets* to
      increase the total stimulus

## Squats

- Starting off light/high rep to get comfortable with the movement pattern
- Start with light dumbbells. Even just the handles is fine.
- After 2-6 weeks we're going to reduce the rep range

## RDLs

- We're starting you off with bilateral

## Bench/OHP

- For simplicity I'm programming 2x bench and 1x OHP a week
    - We could instead alternate bench/OHP for more balanced volume
