# Notes

## Goals

- Third world squats
- Shoulder stretch (hands clasped behind back)
- One armed push-ups
- Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Better glutes
- Front rack flexibility

## Plans

Currently I do OHP/Dip/Curl/Lat Raise twice a week for noob gains. As
progress slows with those I should cut volume and replace them with exercises
that will have more overall impact.

- Near term changes
    - Do some dead hangs w/ suppinated grip for better wrist health.
    - Start alternating grip on rows for elbow health

## Tests

- Periodic Pallof press @ 1/2 bodyweight to verify core rotation

## Idea dump

- Ankle mobility options
    - I'm pretty sure I have anterior ankle impingement. The standard banded mobs don't seem to work.

    - I should consider Tibialis raises if current plans don't work
- Banded Lat Smash
    - This is worth looking into - it sounds as if it might address some tightness I have?
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
    - Current routine may just cover it
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
    - Volume RDLs + Dead hangs should really do it for grip strength
- Calf raises, Calf stretches
    - My calves seem fine? So much DDR with so much weight...
- Core
    - I'm not sure I really need dedicated core work
    - Hanging Leg Raises
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
