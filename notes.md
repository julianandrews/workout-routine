# Notes

## Near term changes

- Do some dead hangs w/ supinated grip for better wrist health.

## Misc Notes

- For the ankle mobilizations, I'm following this protocol:

## Goals

- Upper body
    - Currently: pec/delt/biceps push.
    - Next: reduce volume & weight loss
    - Eventually:
        - Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Lower Body
    - Currently: Bulgarian Split squats
    - Next: Glute hypertrophy
        - Once I'm good on split squats, the current plan is to reduce volume
          to maintenance and then add in some hip thrusts as my new lower body
          strength and mobility driver.
- Mobility & Skill work
    - Currently: ankle mobilty push
    - Eventually:
        - Shoulder stretch mobility (hands clasped behind back)
        - Front rack flexibility
        - Planche pushup progression
        - Handstand progression & handstand pushups

## Idea dump

- Reintroduce chins/one armed pushups
    - With the tennis elbow, it's better to just cut these for a few months
- Thoracic rotation
    - Consider adding load at the end of range for the bretzel by pulling against a resistance band
- Start alternating grip on rows for elbow health
- Ankle mobility options
    - I'm pretty sure I have anterior ankle impingement. The standard banded mobs don't seem to work.

    - I should consider Tibialis raises if current plans don't work
- Banded Lat Smash
    - This is worth looking into - it sounds as if it might address some tightness I have?
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
    - Current routine may just cover it
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
    - Volume RDLs + Dead hangs should really do it for grip strength
- Calf raises
    - My calves seem fine? So much DDR with so much weight...
- Core
    - I'm not sure I really need dedicated core work, but some anti-rotation work might be useful
    - Hanging Leg Raises
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
