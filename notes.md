# Notes

## Near term changes

- Add a set of assisted chin-ups as soon as I have a week with no elbow issues.
- Do some dead hangs w/ supinated grip for better wrist health.

## Goals

- Upper body
    - Currently: pec/delt/biceps push.
    - Next: reduce volume & weight loss
    - Eventually:
        - Real unassisted pull-ups!
- Lower Body
    - Currently: Bulgarian Split squts
    - Next: Glute hypertrophy
- Mobility & Skill work
    - Currently: ankle mobilty push, handstand pushups
    - Eventually:
        - Shoulder stretch mobility (hands clasped behind back)
        - Front rack flexibility
        - Planche pushup progression

## Idea dump

- Start alternating grip on rows for elbow health
- Ankle mobility options
    - I'm pretty sure I have anterior ankle impingement. The standard banded mobs don't seem to work.

    - I should consider Tibialis raises if current plans don't work
- Banded Lat Smash
    - This is worth looking into - it sounds as if it might address some tightness I have?
- Hip thrusts (for glutes)
    - Current routine may just cover it
- Farmer's Carries (for grip/core)
    - Volume RDLs + Dead hangs should really do it for grip strength
- Calf raises, Calf stretches
    - My calves seem fine? So much DDR with so much weight...
- Core
    - I'm not sure I really need dedicated core work, but some anti-rotation work might be useful
    - Hanging Leg Raises
    - Palloff Press (for core rotation)
    - Suitcase carries (obliques, could add to lower body day)
    - Side planks - covers a lot of good stuff, could do 30s/side
